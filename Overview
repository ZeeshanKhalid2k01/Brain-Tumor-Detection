#Overview





We have done following work:

•	Taken an MRI image of brain from user.

•	Resized input image.

•	Applied RGB Filter.

•	Applied Anisotropic Diffusion.

•	Obtained Threshold value in project through Hit and Trial technique.

•	Separating the Threshold-Area image from input image.

•	Separating the High-Dense-Area and putting Boundary box in the image

•	Output Images with previous task.

•	Show the tumor alone in separated image using threshold values

•	Show the tumor outline on another image

•	Show the tumor outline in the separate image

•	Applied the Prewit-filter also, to show the tumor region in another view
